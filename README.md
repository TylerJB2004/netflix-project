#Netflix Content Over load analysis
**Final Project — Data Analysis Using Python**
# DISCLIAMER HTML WAS NOT WORKING
# Project Goal  
Analyze the Netflix global catalog to determine whether users experience **content overload** and identify key trends such as:  
- Movies vs TV Shows distribution  
- Genre popularity  
- Countries producing the most content  
- Catalog growth over time  
- Most common genres for U.S. viewers  

#  Files Included  
- **analysis.ipynb**  Full Jupyter Notebook with graphs, insights, and conclusions  
- **netflix_titles.csv**  Dataset from Kaggle used for the analysis  
- **requirements.txt** Python packages needed to run the notebook  
- **slides**  PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis if provided

  Summary of Key Findings  
- Netflix has more movies than TV shows , which increases browsing difficulty.  
- Most Netflix content comes from a few dominant countries such as the United States and India.  
- Content production spiked heavily between 2017–2020 , contributing to rapid catalog expansion.  
- The most common genres among U.S. viewers include Dramas, Comedies, Documentaries , and Action content.  
- Overall, Netflix’s rapid content growth contributes to content overload , making navigation harder for users.
  Note on HTML Export  
Exporting the notebook to HTML failed due to a local Jupyter/path issue on Windows.  
The full analysis with all graphs and answers is visible in analysis.ipynb and renders correctly on git
  How to Run
